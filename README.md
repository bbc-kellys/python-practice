# Python Practice
This repo is essentially what it says on the tin. I am using this space to learn the Python programming language through various exercices found here :

https://dev.to/pluralsight/my-5-favorite-software-design-principles-4ech

& elsewhere.

I will document what I learn in the learning.md file.
