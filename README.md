# Python Practice
This repo is essentially what it says on the tin. I am using this space to learn the Python programming language through various exercices found here :

https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html

https://dev.to/codemouse92/dead-simple-python-project-structure-and-imports-38c6

& elsewhere.

I will document what I learn in the learning.md file.
